Both cities are mostly in Fort Bend County with lots of active business. There are lots of different types of restaurants and we will try to see how these restaurants distributed and find out the best possible location for a new Asian restaurant."

To have better coverage, we'll define two cities to many small area, then perform restaurant search based on center of each area. The following data will be needed to extract/generate the required restaurant information:\n* coordinates of the center in both cities using folium map.\n* generate small areas in folium map\n* retrieve all restaurants for each area using Foursquare API"
